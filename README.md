# landing-page

I noticed my personal README on github was becoming too cluttered, as I was trying to use it also as a portfolio/landing page. So I decided it was time to move on to a proper, separate web page.

From creating the repo, creating & populating the first (ugly) html file, and deploying it to github pages, it took 15 min.
