# landing-page

I noticed my personal README on github was becoming too cluttered, as I was trying to use it also as a portfolio/landing page. So I decided it was time to move on to a proper, separate web page.

### Timeline
- Creating the repo, first html file (no styling), and deploying it to github pages: 15 min


### Resources:
- [Getting Started with GitHub Pages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyFcl_Fba-k)
- [Build a Portfolio Website & Deploy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_hYR53r61M&list=WL&index=1&t=581s)
- Used this to quickly translate my old README (in markdown) to html: https://markdowntohtml.com/
